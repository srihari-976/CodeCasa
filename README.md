# Spam Email Detection with Machine Learning

In this project, I  will be building an email spam detector using Python.
Spam mail, also known as junk mail, refers to emails sent to a large number
of users simultaneously, often containing deceptive messages, fraudulent
schemes, or potentially harmful phishing content. I will utilize machine
learning techniques to train our spam detector to accurately classify emails
as either spam or non-spam. By developing this detector, I aim to
enhance email security and protect users from falling victim to spam
emails. .
Let's dive into the implementation details and create an effective spam
detection system.
