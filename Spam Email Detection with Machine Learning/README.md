# Spam Email Detection using Machine Learning

This project is a spam email detection system implemented using machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to automatically classify emails as either spam or legitimate (ham) based on their content and characteristics.

## Overview

Spam email is a common nuisance that can clutter inboxes and pose security risks to users. Traditional spam filters often rely on rule-based approaches or simple keyword matching, which may not be effective against evolving spam tactics. Machine learning offers a more robust solution by learning patterns and features from a labeled dataset of spam and ham emails.

In this project, we use a machine learning model to classify emails into spam or ham categories based on various features extracted from the email content, such as:

- Textual content analysis (e.g., frequency of certain words or phrases)
- Metadata analysis (e.g., sender information, email headers)
- Structural analysis (e.g., HTML tags, formatting)

## Features

- **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes a machine learning algorithm (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine) trained on a labeled dataset of spam and ham emails to classify new emails.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracts relevant features from email content and metadata to represent emails as numerical vectors for input to the machine learning model.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Computes evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the performance of the spam detection model.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocesses the email data by cleaning, tokenizing, and transforming it into a suitable format for model training.
- **Model Training and Testing**: Splits the dataset into training and testing sets, trains the machine learning model on the training data, and evaluates its performance on the testing data.

## Usage

To use this project:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Install the necessary Python dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. **Data Preparation**: Prepare the dataset by collecting labeled spam and ham emails. You can use publicly available email datasets or create your own labeled dataset.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the email data by cleaning, tokenizing, and extracting features from the email content and metadata.
4. **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model on the preprocessed dataset using a suitable algorithm (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine).
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model's performance using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model as a spam detection system that can classify new emails in real-time.
