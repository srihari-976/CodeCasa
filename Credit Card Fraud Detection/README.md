## Introduction

Credit card fraud is a significant concern for both financial institutions and cardholders. Detecting fraudulent transactions accurately and efficiently is crucial for preventing financial losses and maintaining trust in the banking system. This project aims to address this challenge by developing a machine learning model that can automatically identify fraudulent transactions based on historical credit card transaction data.

## Features

- Preprocessing of credit card transaction data.
- Implementation of various machine learning algorithms for fraud detection.
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualization of key performance metrics and model predictions.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains credit card transaction data, including features such as transaction amount, merchant information, and transaction timestamp. It is anonymized to protect sensitive information but retains the necessary attributes for fraud detection analysis.

## Model Training

The machine learning model is trained using a supervised learning approach. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with the model trained on the training data and evaluated on the testing data. Various algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, are explored and compared to determine the most effective approach for fraud detection.

## Evaluation

The performance of the machine learning model is evaluated using standard classification metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and precision-recall curves are plotted to assess the model's performance across different thresholds.

## Usage

To use this project:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/srihari-976/CodeCasa/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train the model and perform fraud detection analysis.
